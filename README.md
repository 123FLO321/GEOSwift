> Friedrich Wilhelm Heinrich Alexander von Humboldt (September 14, 1769 – May 6, 1859) was a Prussian geographer, naturalist, and explorer, and the younger brother of the Prussian minister, philosopher and linguist Wilhelm von Humboldt (1767–1835). Humboldt's quantitative work on botanical geography laid the foundation for the field of biogeography. Humboldt's advocacy of long-term systematic geophysical measurement laid the foundation for modern geomagnetic and meteorological monitoring.

## Usage

## What is GEOS?

[GEOS](http://trac.osgeo.org/geos/) stands for Geometry Engine - Open Source, and is a C++ library, ported from the [Java Topology Suite](http://sourceforge.net/projects/jts-topo-suite/). GEOS implements the OpenGIS [Simple Features for SQL](http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/sfs) spatial predicate functions and spatial operators. GEOS, now an OSGeo project, was initially developed and maintained by [Refractions Research](http://www.refractions.net/) of Victoria, Canada.
